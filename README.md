## Object Recognition using Animatronic Eye

We have designed a animatronic eye system to solve Problems like Survillance, multidirection movement camera and real time monitoring.

this type of technology is not used that much in daily life problems like surveillance, security systems, in medical systems, where surgeon need motion scaling of any organ, machine vision systems, manufacturing industries where they need a track record of every manufactured part. Current security cctv cameras are not able to track a particular moving object that they might detect, so this type of technology can help, where we need to track a particular type of target at a time, Also, this type of technology can be used in amphibious smart Bots, where they need to provide real time information of a particular object, when we send them to a spy mission.
